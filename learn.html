    <h1>The Product Afterlife</h1>
    <p>
      The afterlife of a product. What happens to it after we’re done using it? 
      One of the most overlooked stages of production and consumption. When products 
      are not properly recycled, repurposed, or disposed of, they often end up in landfills 
      or oceans, releasing toxins, microplastics, and greenhouse gases that pollute the 
      environment and harm wildlife. This waste contributes to soil and water contamination, 
      accelerates climate change, and depletes natural resources that could have been reused. 
      By researching and addressing the effects of poor product afterlife management, we can 
      create systems that promote sustainability, reduce pollution, and encourage companies 
      and consumers alike to take responsibility for the full lifecycle of the products they 
      make and use.
